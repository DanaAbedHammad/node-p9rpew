<p>Three species of elephants are recognised; the <a >African bush elephant</a> (<i><a >Loxodonta</a> africana</i>) and <a >forest elephant</a> (<i>Loxodonta cyclotis</i>) of <a>sub-Saharan Africa</a>, and the <a >Asian elephant</a> (<i><a >Elephas</a> maximus</i>) of <a >South</a> and <a >Southeast Asia</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-MSW3_10-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> African elephants have larger ears, a concave back, more wrinkled skin, a sloping abdomen, and two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk. Asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or level back, smoother skin, a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension at the tip of the trunk. The looped ridges on the <a>molars</a> are narrower in the Asian elephant while those of the African are more diamond-shaped. The Asian elephant also has <a  >dorsal</a> bumps on its head and some patches of <a>depigmentation</a> on its skin.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani38_11-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Among African elephants, forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants and are limited in range to the forested areas of <a >western</a> and <a >Central Africa</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani42_12-0" class="reference"><a>&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Both were traditionally considered a single species, <i>Loxodonta africana</i>, but molecular studies have affirmed their status as separate species.<sup id="cite_ref-DNA_13-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Ishida_14-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;14&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-genomic_15-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that <i>L. cyclotis</i> is more closely related to the extinct <i><a >Palaeoloxodon antiquus</a></i>, than it is to <i>L. africana,</i> possibly undermining the genus <i>Loxodonta</i> as a whole.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a >&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>

These animals were relatively small and aquatic. Later on, genera such as <i><a >Phiomia</a></i> and <i><a >Palaeomastodon</a></i> arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. Proboscidean diversity declined during the Oligocene.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a >&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> One notable species of this epoch was <i><a >Eritreum</a> melakeghebrekristosi</i> of the <a >Horn of Africa</a>, which may have been an ancestor to several later species.<sup id="cite_ref-link_20-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> The beginning of the <a >Miocene</a> saw the second diversification, with the appearance of the <a

Members of this group included <i><a>Gomphotherium</a></i> and <i><a >Platybelodon</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar17_21-3" class="reference"><a >&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> The third radiation started in the late Miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids, which descended from, and slowly replaced, the gomphotheres.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a >&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> The African <i><a >Primelephas</a> gomphotheroides</i> gave rise to <i>Loxodonta</i>, <i>Mammuthus,</i> and <i>Elephas</i>. <i>Loxodonta</i> branched off earliest around the Miocene and <a >Pliocene</a> boundary while <i>Mammuthus</i> and <i>Elephas</i> diverged later during the early Pliocene. <i>Loxodonta</i> remained in Africa while <i>Mammuthus</i> and <i>Elephas</i> spread to Eurasia, and the former reached North America. At the same time, the <a >stegodontids</a>, another proboscidean group descended from gomphotheres, spread throughout Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, China, southeast Asia, and Japan.

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a ></a></div>African bush elephant skeleton</div></div></div>
<p>Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African bush elephants are the largest species, with males being 304–336&#160;cm (10&#160;ft 0&#160;in&#160;– 11&#160;ft 0&#160;in) tall at the shoulder with a body mass of 5.2–6.9&#160;t (5.7–7.6 short tons) and females standing 247–273&#160;cm (8&#160;ft 1&#160;in&#160;– 8&#160;ft 11&#160;in) tall at the shoulder with a body mass of 2.6–3.5&#160;t (2.9–3.9 short tons). Male Asian elephants are usually about 261–289&#160;cm (8&#160;ft 7&#160;in&#160;– 9&#160;ft 6&#160;in) tall at the shoulder and 3.5–4.6&#160;t (3.9–5.1 short tons) whereas females are 228–252&#160;cm (7&#160;ft 6&#160;in&#160;– 8&#160;ft 3&#160;in) tall at the shoulder and 2.3–3.1&#160;t (2.5–3.4 short tons). African forest elephants are the smallest species, with males usually being around 209–231&#160;cm (6&#160;ft 10&#160;in&#160;– 7&#160;ft 7&#160;in) tall at the shoulder and 1.7–2.3&#160;t (1.9–2.5 short tons). Male African bush elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females.<sup id="cite_ref-Larramendi,_A._2015_25-2" class="reference"><a >&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> 
</p><p>The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani68_34-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a >&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the <a >brain</a> in every direction.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a >&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> The skull contains air cavities (<a >sinuses</a>) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a <a >honeycomb</a>-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani68_34-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support.<sup id="cite_ref-evolution_6-4" class="reference"><a >&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or <a >pinnae</a>, contain numerous blood vessels called <a >capillaries</a>. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a>&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 <a >kHz</a> (in close proximity to the <a>Soprano</a> <a  >C</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a >&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Trunk">Trunk</span></h3>
<p>The trunk, or <a >proboscis</a>, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early <a>fetal</a> life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.<sup id="cite_ref-evolution_6-5" class="reference"><a>&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile appendage. It contains up to 150,000 separate <a >muscle fascicles</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a >&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> with no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided into <a >dorsals, ventrals</a>, and <a >laterals</a> while the latter are divided into <a >transverse</a> and <a >radiating</a> muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. The <a >nasal septum</a> is composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils. <a >Cartilage</a> divides the nostrils at the base.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani74_43-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> As a <a >muscular hydrostat</a>, the trunk moves by precisely coordinated muscle contractions. The muscles work both with and against each other. A unique proboscis nerve – formed by the <a >maxillary</a> and <a>facial nerves</a> – runs along both sides of the trunk.<sup id="cite_ref-trunk_44-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Elephant trunks have multiple functions, including breathing, <a >olfaction</a>, touching, grasping, and sound production.<sup id="cite_ref-evolution_6-6" class="reference"><a >&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a <a >bloodhound</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar149_45-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> The trunk's ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food, wrestle with other elephants,<sup id="cite_ref-Kingdon9_46-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> and lift up to 350&#160;kg (770&#160;lb).<sup id="cite_ref-evolution_6-7" class="reference"><a >&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> It can be used for delicate tasks, such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice,<sup id="cite_ref-Kingdon9_46-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed.<sup id="cite_ref-evolution_6-8" class="reference"><a >&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> With its trunk, an elephant can reach items at heights of up to 7&#160;m (23&#160;ft) and dig for water under mud or sand.<sup id="cite_ref-Kingdon9_46-2" class="reference"><a >&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> Individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunks: some prefer to twist them to the left, others to the right.<sup id="cite_ref-trunk_44-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;44&#93;</a></sup> Elephants are capable of dilating their nostrils at a radius of nearly 30%, increasing the nasal volume by 64%, and can inhale at over 150&#160;m/s (490&#160;ft/s) which is around 30 times the speed of a human sneeze.<sup id="cite_ref-Schulz_47-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;47&#93;</a></sup> Elephants can suck up food and water both to spray in the mouth and, in the case of the latter, to sprinkle on their bodies.<sup id="cite_ref-evolution_6-9" class="reference"><a >&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Schulz_47-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;47&#93;</a></sup> An adult Asian elephant is capable of holding 8.5&#160;L (2.2&#160;US&#160;gal) of water in its trunk.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani74_43-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;43&#93;</a></sup>  They will also spray dust or grass on themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-evolution_6-10" class="reference"><a >&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> When underwater, the elephant uses its trunk as a <a >snorkel</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-snorkel_32-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Teeth">Teeth</span></h3>
<div class="thumb tright"></div>
<p>Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the <a >incisors</a>, known as the <a >tusks</a>, 12 <a >deciduous</a> <a >premolars</a>, and 12 <a >molars</a>. Unlike most mammals, which <a >grow baby teeth</a> and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are <a >polyphyodonts</a> that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9–15 years of age and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani70_49-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;49&#93;</a></sup>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tusks">Tusks</span></h4>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a ></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a></a></div>Asian elephant eating tree bark, using its tusks to peel it off</div></div></div>
<p>The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous <a >milk teeth</a> at 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about 17&#160;cm (7&#160;in) a year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth <a >enamel</a> cap that eventually wears off. The <a >dentine</a> is known as <a >ivory</a> and its <a >cross-section</a> consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral <a >calcite</a>. Much of the tusk can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk contains the <a >pulp</a> and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani71_50-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;50&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Like humans, who are typically <a >right- or left-handed</a>, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. The dominant tusk, called the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. For the African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to 300&#160;cm (9&#160;ft 10&#160;in),<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani71_50-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;50&#93;</a></sup> but those of males tend to be thicker.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a>&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> In earlier times, elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90&#160;kg) were not uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over 100 pounds (45&#160;kg).<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a >&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>

<div class="thumb tright"></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a ></a></div>An African forest elephant covering its skin with mud</div></div></div>
<p>An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5&#160;cm (1&#160;in) thick on the back and parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, <a >anus</a>, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, <a >genitals</a> and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani66_60-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> Their hair is thought to be for <a >thermoregulation</a>, helping them lose heat in their hot environments.<sup id="cite_ref-Elephanthair_61-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;61&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from <a>ultraviolet</a> light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular <a >mud baths</a> to protect it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low <a>surface-area-to-volume ratio</a>, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani66_60-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;60&#93;</a></sup>

<p>To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have <a>cancellous bone</a> in place of <a >medullary cavities</a>. This strengthens the bones while still allowing <a>haematopoiesis</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani69_62-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;62&#93;</a></sup> Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front.<sup id="cite_ref-cushion_63-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> Since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body, an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy. Elephants are incapable of rotating their front legs, as the <a >ulna</a> and <a >radius</a> are fixed in <a >pronation</a>; the "palm" of the manus faces backward.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani69_62-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;62&#93;</a></sup> The <a >pronator quadratus</a> and the <a >pronator teres</a> are either reduced or absent.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a >&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or "cushion pads" beneath the <a >manus</a> or <a >pes</a>, which distribute the weight of the animal.<sup id="cite_ref-cushion_63-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> They appear to have a <a >sesamoid</a>, an extra "toe" similar in placement to a <a >giant panda</a>'s extra "thumb", that also helps in weight distribution.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a >&#91;65&#93;</a></sup> As many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feet.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani38_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shoshani38-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Elephants can move both forwards and backwards, but cannot <a >trot</a>, <a>jump</a>, or <a >gallop</a>. They use only two gaits when moving on land: the walk and a faster gait similar to running.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani69_62-2" class="reference"><a >&#91;62&#93;</a></sup> In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground. With no "aerial phase", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-kinetics_66-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;66&#93;</a></sup> Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of 25&#160;km/h (16&#160;mph).<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_67-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;67&#93;</a></sup> At this speed, most other <a  >quadrupeds</a> are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length.

<p>The brain of an elephant weighs 4.5–5.5&#160;kg (10–12&#160;lb) compared to 1.6&#160;kg (4&#160;lb) for a human brain.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani78_69-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;69&#93;</a></sup> It is the largest of all terrestrial mammals.<sup id="cite_ref-posse_70-0" class="reference"><a >&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is <a >proportionally smaller than the human brain when compared to their size</a>. At birth, an elephant's brain already weighs 30–40% of its adult weight. The <a >cerebrum</a> and <a >cerebellum</a> are well developed, and the <a >temporal lobes</a> are so large that they bulge out laterally.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani78_69-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;69&#93;</a></sup> Their temporal lobes are proportionally larger than in other animals, including humans.<sup id="cite_ref-posse_70-1" class="reference"><a >&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> The throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use.<sup id="cite_ref-evolution_6-12" class="reference"><a >&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The <a  >larynx</a> of the elephant is the largest known among mammals. The <a >vocal folds</a> are long and are attached close to the <a  >epiglottis</a> base. When comparing an elephant's vocal folds to those of a human, an elephant's are longer, thicker, and have a larger cross-sectional area.

</p><p>The heart of an elephant weighs 12–21&#160;kg (26–46&#160;lb).

They have a <a >hindgut fermentation</a> system, and their large and small intestines together reach 35&#160;m (115&#160;ft) in length.
